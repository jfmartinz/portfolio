    Hello! 👋🏻 
    
    I am Joseph Martin, currently an undergraduate Computer Science student at the <a href="https://unc.edu.ph/">University of Nueva Caceres</a>.
    My interest lies in Front-End Development, and I have a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and VueJS.
    Additionally, I am familiar with tools and technologies such as Git & GitHub, Tailwind, Firebase, Pinia, TypeScript, and UI/UX design.

    I actively engage in community discussions, collaborate on open-source projects, and connect with fellow developers 
    to stay updated in the field and further expand my knowledge and skills.
    
    When I am not coding, I like to spend my time on listening to music, reading, and
    solitude.
